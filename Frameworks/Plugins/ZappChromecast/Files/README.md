# Quick Brick Chromecast Integration Plugin

Chromecast (QB) is a custom plugin that provides the core functionality required to incorporate casting into QuickBrick applications. This plugin is one of two plugins required to properly integrate the feature.

This plugin is based on the open source [react-native-google-cast](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-google-cast) package. Now dues to the plugin's lack of AndroidX support along with our existing native implementation we decided to diverge a bit from the original package.
